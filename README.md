# SVEN
A simple unsteady Free Vortex Wake lifting-line filament flow solver 

**SVEN**: (S)olver (V)ortex (E)olie(N)nes

# SCOPE

The objective of this project is to provide a simple and modular implementation of a Free Vortex Wake (FVW) method with a Lifting Line approach and filament discretization, developed in Python. The focus is on simplicity and accessibility for academic use while leveraging the power of GPUs via CUDA for fast computations.

This code is designed to enable the exploration and testing of different models and aspects of the method, without aiming to offer a complete or highly optimized implementation. The emphasis is on flexibility and ease of adaptation to meet the specific needs of users, whether they are researchers, engineers, or students.
